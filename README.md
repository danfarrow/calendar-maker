Calendar Maker
==============

A JavaScript tool to render printable calendars for arbitrary date ranges, in various styles

Increasingly I like having stuff down on paper. I like holding paper, and I like writing with both pens and pencils. I am also trying to be more organised, specifically to schedule my working day.

I made this tool to address both these needs. It allows me to print calendars in various styles so that I can then write on them.

With a bit of luck, and given enough time, this tool will enable me to one day get something done.

Also a learning project

Yes indeed, I'm also building / improving my skills in:
* JavaScript
* GitHub / git
* SASS
* BEM
* Handlebars
* Grunt
* ...er, that's it
